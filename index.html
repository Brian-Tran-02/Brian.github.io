      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        A computer science student at the University of Ottawa, aspiring to
        learn as many things in the world of technologie as humanly possible! I
        love volleyball, I love the gym, and I love cooking! The common factor
        between them all is that every time I go do those activities is another
        chance to improve myself!

      <h2>How I Work</h2>
      <p>
        I learn by trying new things! I find myself retaining the most
        information when I am thrown into the thick of it! I love to be guided
        and learn from my own, and other peoples' mistakes! That is precisely
        why I love to work with a team so we can all get through any given
        problem together!
